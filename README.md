# SudokuSolver
A simple command-line application for solving [Sudokus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

The basis of this application was created as part of the [coding-board.de coding challenge](https://www.coding-board.de/threads/coding-herbst-die-coding-board-de-coding-challenge.39297/).

The actual code submitted as my solution for the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/jr-cologne/SudokuSolver/tree/dda78a35ba4ffe8efc17f7a99e9ee8162d5825d2).

## Getting Started
Just download the latest `.jar` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/jr-cologne/SudokuSolver/releases)
of this Repository and execute it with the following command:

```
java -jar SudokuSolver.jar
```

In case you would like to mess around with the source code, just download an archive file of this project,
unpack it and open the project's code in your favorite text editor or IDE.
You can of course also use the `git clone` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/jr-cologne/SudokuSolver.git
```

## Usage
In order to solve a Sudoku, you have to provide a text file (`.txt`) including the Sudoku as the first argument.

Running the SudokuSolver basically looks like this:

```
java -jar SudokuSolver.jar input.txt
```
